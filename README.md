# population-density-mapnik
A map style for displaying population density based on OpenStreetMap data.

This map shows the population denstity in germany and was made from OpenStreetMap data. The population-tag in OpenStreetMap from boundaries or place-notes within the boundaries was devided by the size of the boundary. So we get the number of people per square kilormetre and we use different shades of green to show this value.
