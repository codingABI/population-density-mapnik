An population per square kilormetre map based on OpenStreetMap data

This map shows the population denstity in germany and was made from OpenStreetMap data. The population-tag in OpenStreetMap from boundaries or place-notes within the boundaries was devided by the size of the boundary. So we get the number of people per square kilormetre and we use different shades of green to show this value.
This should only be an demonstration how the process such OpenStreetMap data. If you really want reliable and current population data, you should ask your goverment for official data.
